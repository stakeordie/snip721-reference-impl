these collection of worklows where designed with a set development process in mind where a developer would create a PR for their changes, this triggers the Test_and_compile workflow. This runs all unit and integration tests and compiles to see if the contract is functioning properly before a senior developer (Luis) checks the code only to suggest implementation and approach changes or approve the PR. 

Once the senior approves the pull request it gets merged into the main branch, This causes the Optimize_wasm workflow to get triggered, It creates a Optimized wasm file as artifact. This artifact can be downloaded to deploy locally or can be deployed using the Store_On-chain workflow

Before Triggering the Store_On-chain make sure you have set these repository secrets the names asre case sensitive, MNEMONIC containing a mnemonic to a wallet with funds, and ACCESS_TOKEN which contains a personal access token with repo rights generated in github.

The final worklow needs to be manually triggered by going to the actions tab and selecting the Store_On-chain action, It will ask you to set the gas limit and select the network you want to deploy to (Mainnet or Testnet). The workflow downloads the optimized wasm artifact generated by the Optimized_wasm workflow and store it on-chain through the use of a npx executable.
